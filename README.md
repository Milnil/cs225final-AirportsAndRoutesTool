# CS225 Final Project: Airport Navigation Tool
### [Presentation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Bg5zJc7rk)
## Data
We will be using datasets from [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html). Specifically, we will be utilizing the airport dataset and route dataset in our project.
* [Airport Navigation Tool Nodes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/airports.dat) (Airport ID, Location, Set of Neighbors)
* [Airport Naviation Tool Edges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/routes.dat)

## Repo Structure
### Deliverables
* All major files that contain our functions and classes are in the [src](https://github.com/Milnil/cs225final-nerds/tree/main/src) directory.
* Datasets are stored as csv files in `/data`
* Tests are in `/tests`
* Project report, development log, contract, etc. are in `/documents`

## Running Instructions
Make sure you are running the program in Docker. If not, follow [this guide](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/sp2022/resources/own-machine/) to get started.

### Executable
To use our Airport Navigation Tool, run the following in the root directory of the repository:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./main
```
Then follow the instructions in the terminal.


#### For example:
For the first prompt, enter: `../data/large_airports.csv`


For the second prompt, enter: `../data/large_routes.csv`


For the third prompt, enter: `1`


Your output should be: `There is a route from source to destination`

We call all functions in main for you. The required inputs for each of the functionality are as follows:

* Flight Path Exists (BFS)
  * Input: two Integer IDs for the source airport and destination airport 
  * Output: a boolean that states whether a path from the starting and ending airport exists
* Shortest Path (Dijkstra's)
  * Input: two Integer IDs for the source airport and destination airport 
  * Output: the shortest path between the airport nodes represented as a vector of Integers
* Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju's)
  * Input: an Integer ID for an airport
  * Output: a list of airport IDs that have a path to input airport

In addition to the above functions called in `/entry/main.cpp`, you can also refer to the input and output definitions in the comments for each small function in  `airportnodes.h` and `graph.h`. 
### Tests
To run the test cases, run `make test` then `./test` in the root directory.

We constructed a small, medium, and large size data set in our /data directory to be used in testing and which are available for the user to use when running the program. We used these data sets to test the functionality of our data parsing and storage method on datasets with incomplete data. We also tested the functionality of our Djikstraâ€™s algorithm on finding the shortest path between airports, our BFS algorithm on finding if a path existed between airports, and our Strongly Connected Components algorithm on finding the set of strongly connected airport nodes.
