# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
Our team will meet for 1-2 hours weekly. We will use Discord to host these meetings or meet in person. Milind will take notes during our meetings.

2. **Assistance** 
Teammates can ask for assistance on Discord. Response time should be within 24 hours. 

3. **Respect** 
We will ensure that every member has an opportunity to speak by having every individual share their contributions within the group at the beginning of each meeting. Every member will actively listen and engage with the thoughts of others by regularly asking questions and offering feedback. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will discuss at the end of each meeting what each member needs to do for the following week to balance the workload. When unexpected complications or unforeseen work arise, members should notify the rest of the group members ahead of time before the next meeting and update the group on their contribution afterward.

5. **Time Commitment** 
Each team member is expected to complete around 2-3 hours of work a week. Currently, there are no prior time commitments that need to be accounted for, but we will work around any sudden changes in time commitments if they occur and reschedule meetings accordingly. These conflicts will be discussed on Discord and if a team member is unable to attend a meeting, he/she will message updates to the group instead. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
If any issue arises, the team will discuss the issue and reach either a compromise or a solution. Teammates will also hold each other accountable for tardiness or lack of effort and will be sure to bring up these issues should they arise. If the issues are not resolvable we will contact course staff to assist us.
