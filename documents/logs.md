# Development Log #1 (Date: 11/02/22 -- 11/04/22)

## Weekly Goals
- Finish Team Contract
- Finish Project Proposal
- Create GitHub repository
Make sure everyone understands the scope and objective of our project
## Specific Tasks Completed
- Finish Team Contract 	-everyone
- Finish Project Proposal -everyone
- Create GitHub repository -everyone
## Problems Encountered 
- None yet
## Plans for next week
- Create node class for Airport data
- Create function that constructs graph using airport and route data
- Create function that parses through airport dataset and route dataset files
## Optional: Questions for mentor
- Does this project seem feasible and can we have two different graphs to store our data?
- Are there problems with the algorithms of our project? 


# Development Log #2 (Date: 11/07/22 -- 11/13/22)

## Weekly Goals
- Set up a node class for airport dataset (COMPLETED)
- Construct a graph containing all the airports and their respective IDs and coordinates (IN PROGRESS)
- Create a function that takes in user input to start closest airport implemenation (IN PROGRESS)
- Create a function that parses through airport dataset and route dataset (IN PROGRESS)
## Specific Tasks Completed
- Created airport node class
- outlines adjacency list based graph class
- created testing methods
## Problems Encountered 
- Nothing yet
## Plans for next week
- Finish work that is currently in progress
- Implement closest airport using BFS
- Make test cases for closest airport
- Begin working on A start algorithm

# Development Log #3 (Date: 11/14/22 -- 11/18/22)

## Weekly Goals
Implement closest airport using BFS algorithm
Make test cases for BFS algorithm
Start implementing A star (shortest path) algorithm
## Specific Tasks Completed

Start working on presentation

# Development Log #4 (Date: 11/28/22 -- 12/02/22)

## Weekly Goals
Finish BFS algorithm (complete)
Make test cases for BFS algorithm (complete)
Start implementing Dijkstra’s algorithm (complete)
Start working on presentation (X)
## Specific Tasks Completed
- Completed the BFS algorithm and test cases
- Made a basic version of our Djikstra's algorithm
- Fixed our data parsing and storage to account for problems in the data set
## Problems Encountered 
- Commas in the titles of Airports in our csv
- Our BFS algorithm taking too long
## Plans for next week
- Finish our Djikstras with test cases
- Work on our next algorithm
- Complete all the other pieces of our project in time for the presentation
